TTTTT
=====

Transformable Text Tic Tac Toe is a little Tic Tac Toe game I made in Ruby for the purpose of programming in Ruby. You can set the size of the board (up to 9! more with some tweaking...), the required in-a-row number to win, the number of players (infinite...). I intend to make a version with a GUI sometime soon, or just make another game to work with GUIs.
